<h1>Travel Bucketlist: Barcelona</h1>
<p>Created by Cindy Lu</p>

<div id="map1">
  <p id="bio">Studying abroad in Barcelona for a summer was one of the best experiences of my college career. I was able to explore a part of the world I knew very little about. During my time in Spain I was able to engage in the local culture, eat amazing food, and experience so many of the city's attractions. Barcelona has become one of my favorite cities in the world. I hope to share its wonders and joys with others!</p>
